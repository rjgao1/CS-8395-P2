## Make sure to download and install the Vuforia 10.5.5 package. This packages was not included in this repo due to its size. 

This project includes a basic script that defines the behavior of the virtual button. When the button is pressed, `Bookinfo` object is set to inactive and `Bookreview` is set to active. When the button is released, `Bookinfo` is set to active and `Bookreview` is set to inactive. By default, `Bookinfo` is active and `Bookreview` is inactive. 

The virtual button is located at the barcode on the back of the book. It is not visualized, which is a limitation.
